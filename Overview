This project simulates the working of a computer file system to demonstrate how files and directories are managed by an operating system.
It provides functionalities such as file creation, deletion, searching, and directory management. The system also visualizes disk space allocation and implements different file allocation techniques and disk scheduling algorithms.
The project helps in understanding core operating system concepts like file organization, metadata management, access control, and disk management in a practical manner.
